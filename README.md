This project is a simple Python program that uses two moving averages (50-day and 200-day) to decide when to buy or sell a stock. It backtests this strategy using historical data, calculates performance metrics like total return and risk, and compares the results to simply holding the stock. This helps beginners learn about trading, data analysis, and Python programming.

Features:
	•	Download stock data from Yahoo Finance
	•	Apply a moving average crossover trading strategy
	•	Calculate key performance metrics (return, Sharpe ratio, drawdown)
	•	Visualize buy/sell signals and portfolio value
	•	Compare strategy performance to buy-and-hold

pip install yfinance matplotlib
