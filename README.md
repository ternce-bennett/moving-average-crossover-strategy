# Moving Average Crossover Trading Strategy

A simple Python program that implements a **moving average crossover trading strategy** using historical stock data. This project is designed for beginners to learn about algorithmic trading, data analysis, and Python programming.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The strategy uses two moving averagesâ€”**50-day** and **200-day**â€”to generate buy and sell signals:

- **Buy signal:** When the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average (golden cross).
- **Sell signal:** When the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average (death cross).

The program backtests this strategy on historical stock price data, calculates performance metrics, and compares the results to a simple buy-and-hold approach.
